Run npm install

Use `npx babel --watch src --out-dir . --presets react-app/prod` to edit the files
in `src`. This command will transpile the JSX into a format that can be used by the
browser

Launch the app by opening `index.html` in the browser.

Change the demo by commenting and uncommneting the different js scripts
